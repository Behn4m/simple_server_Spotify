## Introduction

The Spotify Interface Module is designed to handle authorization and communication with the Spotify service on embedded systems, particularly using ESP-IDF.

## File Structure

- `SpotifyInterface.c`: Implementation file containing the implementation of functions defined in the header and private functions used to handle tasks.
- `SpotifyMakeRequest.c`: Implementation of the functions which make web requests needed to communicate with the Spotify Web Service.
- `JsonExtraction.c`: Implementation of functions to extract keys from Spotify responses.
- `SpotifyInterface.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and structure definitions.
- `SpotifyMakeRequest.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
- `JsonExtraction.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Includes the dependencies, directories, and other CMake configurations.

## Dependencies

- ESP-IDF: Espressif IoT Development Framework
- Other libraries and modules as specified in the `#include` directives within the header file.

## Features

- Authorization with Spotify API.
- Handling user information and tokens securely.
- Sending commands to Spotify (play, pause, stop, next, previous, etc.).

## API Reference

**Spotify_TaskInit:** Checks if all mandatory fileds are addressed

```c
bool Spotify_TaskInit(SpotifyInterfaceHandler_t *SpotifyInterfaceHandler);
```

**Spotify_PlayBackCommand:** Gets the command and sends releavant request to Spotify web service

```c
bool Spotify_IsConnected(SpotifyInterfaceHandler_t *SpotifyInterfaceHandler);
```

**Spotify_IsConnected:** Checks if Authorization is done successfully
```c

bool Spotify_PlaybackCommand(char *command);
```

## How to use it

This guide provides instructions on how to use the Spotify Interface Handler module in your project. The Spotify Interface Handler facilitates interactions with the Spotify service, allowing you to perform various operations like sending commands, managing tokens, and checking the service's status.

**Step 1:** Include Header File

```c
#include "https_spotify.h"
```

**Step 2:** Create an Instance

```c
SpotifyInterfaceHandler_t SpotifyInterfaceHandler;
```

**Step 3:** Initialize the Handler

```c
SpotifyInterfaceHandler.HttpsBufQueue = QueueSharedWithHttpsModule;
SpotifyInterfaceHandler.HttpsResponseReadySemaphore = SemaphoreSharedWithHttpsModule;
SpotifyInterfaceHandler.ConfigAddressInSpiffs = SpotifyConfigAddressInSpiffs;
SpotifyInterfaceHandler.ReadTxtFileFromSpiffs = &SpiffsWritefunction;
SpotifyInterfaceHandler.WriteTxtFileToSpiffs = &SpiffsReadfunction;
SpotifyInterfaceHandler.CheckAddressInSpiffs = &SpiffsAddressCheckfunction;
```

**Step 4:** Call Initialization Function

```c
if (Spotify_TaskInit(&SpotifyInterfaceHandler))
{
    // Handler initialized successfully
} else 
{
    // Handler initialization failed, handle the error
}
```

**Step 5:** Use APIs to send Playback commands to Spotify

```c
if(Spotify_PlaybackCommand("play"))
{
    // play command successfully sent to Spotify
}
else
{
    // failed to send play command to Spotify
}
```
